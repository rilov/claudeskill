## 🎭 How It Works - Behind the Scenes

### 1. **You Upload the Skill**
When you upload this folder to Claude, it gains access to all these files.

### 2. **Claude Reads the Instructions**
The `SKILL.md` file tells Claude:
- What this skill does
- When to use it
- How to approach calculator creation
- What templates are available
- Best practices to follow

### 3. **Claude Uses the Resources**
When you ask for a calculator, Claude:
- Checks the templates for a starting point
- Looks up formulas in the references
- Follows the workflow in SKILL.md
- Creates customized output based on your needs

### 4. **Claude Explains Everything**
Because this is an educational skill, Claude also:
- Adds comments explaining the code
- Describes how calculations work
- Shows how to modify the calculator
- Teaches the underlying concepts

## 🚀 Try It Yourself!

### Step 1: Upload to Claude
1. Download this entire folder
2. Go to Claude.ai
3. Click "Upload files" or drag the folder
4. Claude will recognize it as a skill

### Step 2: Test the Skill
Try these prompts to see it in action:

```
"Create a simple calculator for me"
"Make a tip calculator"
"Build a mortgage calculator"
"I need a BMI calculator"
"Use Python to calculate compound interest"
"Generate 5 different calculators with Python"
```

### Step 3: Test Python Scripts Locally (Optional)
You can run the Python scripts directly to see how they work:

```bash
# Run the interactive demonstration
python scripts/demo.py

# Test the calculation engine
python scripts/calculator_engine.py demo

# Generate a calculator HTML file
python scripts/generate_calculator.py generate basic "My Calc" "add,multiply" blue

# See all options
python scripts/demo.py all
```

### Step 4: Observe How Claude Responds
Notice how Claude:
- References the skill's instructions
- Uses the provided templates
- Explains what it's doing
- Adds educational comments
- Follows the best practices
