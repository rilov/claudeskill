## What is a Claude Skill? {#what-is-skill}

### The Simple Answer

Imagine you have a really smart friend named Claude who can help you with many things. But sometimes, you want Claude to be EXTRA good at one specific thing — like making calculators!

**A Claude Skill is like giving Claude a specialized instruction manual** that makes Claude an expert at that one specific task.

---

## 🍳 Understanding Through a Kitchen Analogy

**To help you understand how this skill works, we'll use a restaurant kitchen analogy throughout this guide.**

Think of this Claude Skill as a **professional kitchen** where Claude is the **master chef**. Just like a well-organized kitchen, this skill has everything organized and labeled:

```mermaid

    style C fill:#26a69a
    style D fill:#ffb74d
    style E fill:#ab47bc
    style F fill:#ffb74d
```

### The Kitchen Components:

| Kitchen Item | In This Skill | What It Does |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 📕 **Recipe Book** | `SKILL.md` | Master instructions telling Claude exactly how to work |
| 🔪 **Kitchen Tools** | `scripts/` folder | Python programs (like professional mixers and processors) |
| 📋 **Recipe Cards** | `templates/` folder | 5 pre-made calculator designs ready to customize |
| 🍽️ **Display Case** | `examples/` folder | Finished calculator samples showing what's possible |
| 📖 **Cookbook** | `references/` folder | Reference formulas and information to look up |

**Throughout this guide, we'll refer back to this kitchen analogy** to make everything clear and connected. When you see kitchen terms like "recipe," "tools," or "ingredients," remember they're helping explain the technical components!

---

### Quick Analogy: How It Works

**When you order a calculator:**
1. 👤 **You** (the customer) tell Claude what you want
2. 📕 **Claude** checks the Recipe Book (SKILL.md) for instructions
3. 📋 **Claude** picks a Recipe Card (template) that fits your needs
4. 🔪 **Claude** uses Kitchen Tools (Python scripts) if needed
5. 📖 **Claude** looks up any formulas in the Cookbook (references)
6. 🍽️ **Claude** might check the Display Case (examples) for inspiration
7. ✨ **Claude** delivers your custom calculator!

**Now let's explore each component in detail...**

## The Restaurant Analogy: Claude as a Chef

Let's start by understanding Claude's role. Think of Claude as a talented chef who can cook many different foods. A Claude Skill is like:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[👨‍🍳 Claude<br/>The Chef] -->|Without Skill| B[Can cook<br/>basic meals]
    A -->|With Calculator Skill| C[Calculator Expert!<br/>Perfect calculators<br/>every time]

    B --> D[Makes okay calculators<br/>might forget things]
    C --> E[Follows best practices<br/>Uses templates<br/>Adds Python power]

    style A fill:#0d47a1
    style C fill:#1b5e20
    style E fill:#263238
```

**Without a skill:** Claude can make calculators, but might do it differently each time

**With a skill:** Claude follows the same proven recipe every time, making perfect calculators!

---

## 📕 The Recipe Book: SKILL.md {#skill-md}

**Remember our kitchen analogy?** This is the master recipe book that sits on the chef's counter!

### What is SKILL.md?

The `SKILL.md` file is the **master instruction manual** for Claude. Just like a chef's recipe book tells them exactly how to make each dish with the right steps and ingredients, SKILL.md tells Claude exactly how to create calculators.

### What's Inside?

Think of SKILL.md as a textbook divided into chapters:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[📕 SKILL.md<br/>The Master Manual] --> B[Chapter 1:<br/>What This Skill Does]
    A --> C[Chapter 2:<br/>When to Use It]

    A --> F[Chapter 5:<br/>Python Scripts Info]
    
    B --> B1[Explains the purpose]
    C --> C1[Tells Claude when to activate]
    D --> D1[Lists exact steps to follow]
    E --> E1[Quality guidelines]
    F --> F1[How to use Python]

    style D fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style E fill:#ab47bc
    style F fill:#26a69a,color:#000000
```

### Breaking It Down: The Sections

#### 1. **What This Skill Does** 📚
**Like:** The introduction to a cookbook that explains what kind of food you'll learn to make

**Contains:**
- "This skill helps Claude create simple, interactive calculators"
- "It shows structured guidance, templates, and best practices"

**Why it matters:** Claude reads this first to understand the purpose

---

#### 2. **Calculator Creation Workflow** 🛠️

This section is like a **step-by-step cooking recipe**:

**Step 1: Identify Calculator Type**
```
User: "I need a tip calculator"
Claude thinks: "Okay, that's a financial calculator type"
```

**Step 2: Use the Appropriate Template**
```
Claude looks in /templates/ folder
Finds: financial-calculator.html (has loan, investment, savings, and tip calculators)
Focuses on: The tip calculator section
```

**Step 3: Customize the Template**
```
Claude modifies it:
- Changes title to "Tip Calculator"
- Adjusts for bill amount and tip percentage
- Updates the calculation logic
```

**Step 4: Add Educational Comments**
```javascript
// This function calculates the tip amount
function calculateTip(billAmount, tipPercent) {
    // Convert percentage to decimal (15% = 0.15)
    const tipDecimal = tipPercent / 100;
    // Multiply bill by tip percentage
    return billAmount * tipDecimal;
}
```

**Step 5: Test and Deliver**
```
Claude creates the final calculator and explains how to use it
```

---

#### 3. **Best Practices** 💡

This section is like **cooking tips from a master chef**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[🎯 Best Practices] --> B[✅ Input Validation<br/>Check numbers are valid]
    A --> C[✅ Clear Labels<br/>Tell users what to enter]
    A --> D[✅ Error Handling<br/>Show helpful messages]
    A --> E[✅ Reset Button<br/>Let users start over]
    
    style A fill:#66bb6a,color:#000000
    style B fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style C fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style D fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style E fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
```

**Example from the skill:**
```javascript
// GOOD: Clear variable names and comments
function calculateBMI(weightKg, heightM) {
    // BMI = weight in kg / (height in meters)²
    const bmi = weightKg / (heightM * heightM);
    return bmi.toFixed(1); // Round to 1 decimal place
}

// BAD: Unclear code
function calc(w, h) {
    return w/(h*h);
}
```

---

#### 4. **Python Script Information** 🐍

This tells Claude about the special Python powers available:

**Think of it like:** The chef discovering they have a professional mixer, food processor, and other advanced tools!

```
Regular tools (JavaScript): Good for simple calculators
Power tools (Python): Can do complex math, create multiple files, analyze data
```

---

### How Claude Reads SKILL.md

When you ask Claude to create a calculator:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude
    participant SKILL as SKILL.md

    You->>Claude: "Create a tip calculator"
    
    Note over Claude: 1. Opens SKILL.md

## 🔪 The Kitchen Tools: scripts/ folder {#scripts-folder}

**Back to our kitchen analogy!** Every professional kitchen has special tools - mixers, food processors, professional ovens. These tools let the chef do things that would be impossible by hand.

The `scripts/` folder contains **Python programs** that are Claude's power tools! Just like a chef uses a food processor to do in seconds what would take hours by hand, Claude uses these Python scripts to perform complex calculations instantly.

### Overview: The Three Tools

### Tool #1: calculator_engine.py — The Calculator Brain 🧠

**What it does:** Performs complex calculations that would be hard to do in a web browser

**Think of it as:** A scientific calculator that can do thousands of calculations per second

#### Capabilities:

**1. Basic Math** ➕➖✖️➗
```python
# Simple example
calc.basic_operation(10, 5, "multiply")
# Result: 50
```

**2. Scientific Functions** 🔬
```python
# Calculate sine, cosine, square root, etc.
calc.scientific_calculation(45, "sin")
# Result: 0.7071 (sine of 45 degrees)
```

**3. Financial Calculations** 💰
```python
# Calculate loan payments
calc.loan_payment(
    principal=200000,    # $200,000 loan
    annual_rate=4.5,     # 4.5% interest
    years=30             # 30 year loan
)
# Result: Monthly payment = $1,013.37
```

**4. Statistical Analysis** 📊
```python
# Analyze a dataset
data = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 45]
calc.statistics(data)
# Result: Mean=53.9, Median=50.5, Std Dev=26.8
```

#### How Claude Uses It:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Claude
    participant Engine as calculator_engine.py

    User->>Claude: "What's the monthly payment<br/>on a $200k loan at 4.5%<br/>for 30 years?"
    
    Note over Claude: This needs complex math!<br/>I'll use Python
    
    Claude->>Engine: loan_payment(200000, 4.5, 30)
    
    Note over Engine: Calculating using formula:<br/>M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]
    
    Engine-->>Claude: {<br/>  monthly_payment: 1013.37<br/>  total_paid: 364,813.42<br/>  total_interest: 164,813.42<br/>}
    
    Claude-->>User: Your monthly payment<br/>would be $1,013.37<br/><br/>Over 30 years you'll pay<br/>$164,813.42 in interest!
```

#### Real Code Example:

```python
def loan_payment(self, principal: float, annual_rate: float, 
                years: int) -> CalculationResult:
    """
    Calculate monthly loan payment
    """
    # Convert to monthly values
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 100 / 12
    num_payments = years * 12
    
    # Calculate payment using the formula
    payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments) / \
             ((1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments - 1)
    
    total_paid = payment * num_payments
    total_interest = total_paid - principal
    
    return {
        "monthly_payment": round(payment, 2),
        "total_paid": round(total_paid, 2),
        "total_interest": round(total_interest, 2)
    }
```

**Why this is amazing:** Claude can do in 1 second what would take minutes with a regular calculator!

    B --> B1[Custom operations]
    B --> B2[Color themes]
    B --> B3[Any combination]
    
    C --> C1[Financial: Loan, Investment, Savings, Tip]
    C --> C2[Health: BMI, BMR, Body Fat, Water]
    C --> C3[Converter: Length, Weight, Temp, Volume]
    C --> C4[Percentage: All types]
    
    style A fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style B fill:#64b5f6,color:#000000
    style C fill:#ab47bc
```

#### Example: Building a Custom Calculator

**You tell Claude:** "Create a blue calculator that can add, multiply, and calculate powers"

**What happens behind the scenes:**

```python
# Claude calls the generator
generator = CalculatorGenerator()

html = generator.generate_basic_calculator(
    title="My Custom Calculator",
    operations=["add", "multiply", "power"],
    color_scheme="blue"
)

# Save the file
generator.save_calculator(html, "my_calculator.html")
```

**Result:** A complete, working HTML file is created in seconds!

#### The Magic Inside:

The generator has **templates built into the code** that it fills in with your specifications:

```python
def generate_basic_calculator(self, title, operations, color_scheme):
    # Starts with base HTML template
    html = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>{TITLE_GOES_HERE}</title>
        <style>{COLORS_GO_HERE}</style>
    </head>
    <body>
        {CALCULATOR_GOES_HERE}
        {BUTTONS_GO_HERE}
    </body>
    </html>
    """
    
    # Fills in the blanks with your specifications
    # Returns complete, working HTML
    return html
```

**It's like Mad Libs, but for code!**

## 📋 The Recipe Cards: templates/ folder {#templates-folder}

**In our kitchen analogy**, these are the pre-written recipe cards! A chef doesn't write a new recipe from scratch every time - they have tried-and-tested recipes that they can follow and customize.

### What are Templates?

**Templates are pre-made calculator designs** that Claude can customize for your needs.

**Think of them as:** Recipe cards where the basic steps are written, but you can adjust the ingredients (colors, labels, specific calculations) to suit each customer's taste!

### The Five Templates:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[📁 templates/] --> B[basic-calculator.html<br/>Simple 4-function calculator]
    A --> C[percentage-calculator.html<br/>Percentage calculations]
    A --> D[financial-calculator.html<br/>Money calculations]

<button onclick="calculate()">Calculate</button>
```

#### After Claude Customizes:
```html
<h1>🍕 Pizza Tip Calculator</h1>
<input id="num1" placeholder="Bill amount ($)">
<input id="num2" placeholder="Tip percentage (%)">
<button onclick="calculate()">Calculate Tip 💰</button>
```

**Same structure, different content!**

    A --> D[🎨 Consistency<br/>Same professional look]
    A --> E[🔧 Customizable<br/>Easy to modify]
    
    style A fill:#66bb6a
```

**It's like having a coloring book** — the outline is done, you just add the colors and details!

---

## 🍽️ The Display Case: examples/ folder {#examples-folder}

**Remember our kitchen analogy!** This is like the display case at a bakery or restaurant - it shows finished dishes so customers can see what's possible and how beautiful the final result looks.

### What are Examples?

**Examples are complete, working calculators** that show what's possible.

**Think of them as:** The glass display case where finished dishes are showcased! Customers (and the chef) can see exactly how the final product should look, what garnishes to use, and how to present it beautifully.

### The Examples:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[📁 examples/] --> B[tip-calculator.html<br/>Complete tip calculator]

    C --> C3[🔗 Shows integration]
    
    style A fill:#ab47bc
    style B fill:#64b5f6
    style C fill:#ffb74d
```

### How Claude Uses Examples:

**When you ask:** "Create a tip calculator with bill splitting"

**Claude thinks:**
1. "Let me check the tip calculator example..."
2. "Oh! I can see how they handled tip percentages"
3. "And I can add bill splitting using the same pattern"
4. "Let me create something similar but customized for your needs"

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude
    participant Examples as examples/<br/>tip-calculator.html

    You->>Claude: "Make a tip calculator with<br/>bill splitting for 4 people"
    
    Claude->>Examples: Open tip calculator example
    Examples-->>Claude: Here's how to:<br/>- Calculate tips<br/>- Display results<br/>- Style the interface
    
    Note over Claude: I'll use this as inspiration<br/>and add bill splitting!
    
    Claude-->>You: ✅ Here's your custom<br/>tip calculator with<br/>4-way bill splitting!
```

### What Makes Examples Special:

Examples include **extensive educational comments**:

```javascript
// TIP CALCULATOR - Complete Example
// This demonstrates best practices for calculator creation

function calculateTip() {
    // STEP 1: Get the input values
    // We use parseFloat to convert text to numbers
    const billAmount = parseFloat(document.getElementById('bill').value);
    const tipPercent = parseFloat(document.getElementById('tip').value);
    
    // STEP 2: Validate inputs
    // Always check if the user entered valid numbers!
    if (isNaN(billAmount) || isNaN(tipPercent)) {
        alert('Please enter valid numbers');
        return;  // Stop the function if inputs are invalid
    }
    
    // STEP 3: Calculate the tip
    // Tip amount = bill × (percentage ÷ 100)
    const tipAmount = billAmount * (tipPercent / 100);
    
    // STEP 4: Calculate total
    const totalAmount = billAmount + tipAmount;
    
    // STEP 5: Display results
    // Use toFixed(2) to show exactly 2 decimal places (dollars and cents)
    document.getElementById('tipAmount').textContent = tipAmount.toFixed(2);
    document.getElementById('total').textContent = totalAmount.toFixed(2);
}

## 📖 The Reference Cookbook: references/ folder {#references-folder}

**In our kitchen analogy**, this is the comprehensive cookbook with all the standard recipes, cooking temperatures, ingredient conversions, and culinary techniques! When the chef needs to know "how long to cook chicken" or "what temperature for bread," they look it up here.

### What is references/?

**The references folder contains reference materials** — formulas, calculations, and explanations that Claude can look up.

**Think of it as:** The professional cookbook that sits on the shelf - filled with precise measurements, cooking times, and techniques. When Claude (the chef) needs to know the exact formula for BMI or loan calculations, this is where they look it up!

### What's Inside: formulas.md

### Example: The BMI Formula

**From formulas.md:**

```markdown
### BMI (Body Mass Index)

**Metric Formula:**
BMI = weight_kg / (height_m × height_m)

**Imperial Formula:**
BMI = (weight_lbs / (height_inches × height_inches)) × 703

**Categories:**
- Underweight: < 18.5
- Normal: 18.5 - 24.9
- Overweight: 25 - 29.9
- Obese: ≥ 30

**Example:**
Person: 70 kg, 1.75 meters tall
BMI = 70 / (1.75 × 1.75) = 70 / 3.0625 = 22.9
Category: Normal weight
```

### How Claude Uses the Reference:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude
    participant Ref as references/<br/>formulas.md

    You->>Claude: "Create a BMI calculator"
    
    Note over Claude: I need the BMI formula...
    
    Claude->>Ref: Look up BMI formula
    Ref-->>Claude: BMI = weight / (height²)<br/>Metric & Imperial versions<br/>Categories included
    
    Note over Claude: Perfect! Now I have:<br/>✓ Correct formula<br/>✓ Both unit systems<br/>✓ Category ranges
    
    Claude-->>You: Here's your BMI calculator!<br/><br/>[Shows calculator with<br/>both metric and imperial,<br/>plus category indicator]
```

### Why References Are Important:

**1. Accuracy** ✅
```
Claude doesn't have to remember formulas
Looks them up to ensure correctness
No mistakes in calculations
```

**2. Consistency** 🎯
```
Same formula every time
Same categories and ranges
Professional quality
```

**3. Completeness** 📚
```
Includes edge cases
Has examples
Shows best practices
```
