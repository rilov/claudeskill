## What is a Claude Skill? {#what-is-skill}

### The Simple Answer

Imagine you have a really smart friend named Claude who can help you with many things. But sometimes, you want Claude to be EXTRA good at one specific thing — like making calculators!

**A Claude Skill is like giving Claude a specialized instruction manual** that makes Claude an expert at that one specific task.

### The Restaurant Analogy

Think of Claude as a talented chef who can cook many different foods. A Claude Skill is like:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[👨‍🍳 Claude<br/>The Chef] -->|Without Skill| B[Can cook<br/>basic meals]
    A -->|With Calculator Skill| C[Calculator Expert!<br/>Perfect calculators<br/>every time]

    B --> D[Makes okay calculators<br/>might forget things]
    C --> E[Follows best practices<br/>Uses templates<br/>Adds Python power]

    style A fill:#0d47a1
    style C fill:#1b5e20
    style E fill:#263238
```

**Without a skill:** Claude can make calculators, but might do it differently each time

**With a skill:** Claude follows the same proven recipe every time, making perfect calculators!

---

## The Magic Recipe Book (SKILL.md) {#skill-md}

### What is SKILL.md?

The `SKILL.md` file is the **master instruction manual** for Claude. It's like the recipe book that tells the chef exactly how to make each dish.

### What's Inside?

Think of SKILL.md as a textbook divided into chapters:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[📕 SKILL.md<br/>The Master Manual] --> B[Chapter 1:<br/>What This Skill Does]
    A --> C[Chapter 2:<br/>When to Use It]

### Breaking It Down: The Sections

#### 1. **What This Skill Does** 📚
**Like:** The introduction to a cookbook that explains what kind of food you'll learn to make

**Contains:**
- "This skill helps Claude create simple, interactive calculators"
- "It shows structured guidance, templates, and best practices"

**Why it matters:** Claude reads this first to understand the purpose

---

#### 2. **Calculator Creation Workflow** 🛠️

This section is like a **step-by-step cooking recipe**:

**Step 1: Identify Calculator Type**
```
User: "I need a tip calculator"
Claude thinks: "Okay, that's a financial calculator type"
```

**Step 2: Use the Appropriate Template**
```
Claude looks in /templates/ folder
Finds: financial-calculator.html (has loan, investment, savings, and tip calculators)
Focuses on: The tip calculator section
```

**Step 3: Customize the Template**
```
Claude modifies it:
- Changes title to "Tip Calculator"
- Adjusts for bill amount and tip percentage
- Updates the calculation logic
```

**Step 4: Add Educational Comments**
```javascript
// This function calculates the tip amount
function calculateTip(billAmount, tipPercent) {
    // Convert percentage to decimal (15% = 0.15)
    const tipDecimal = tipPercent / 100;
    // Multiply bill by tip percentage
    return billAmount * tipDecimal;
}
```

**Step 5: Test and Deliver**
```
Claude creates the final calculator and explains how to use it
```

    A[🎯 Best Practices] --> B[✅ Input Validation<br/>Check numbers are valid]
    A --> C[✅ Clear Labels<br/>Tell users what to enter]
    A --> D[✅ Error Handling<br/>Show helpful messages]
    A --> E[✅ Reset Button<br/>Let users start over]
    
    style A fill:#66bb6a,color:#000000
    style B fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style C fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style D fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style E fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
```

**Example from the skill:**
```javascript
// GOOD: Clear variable names and comments
function calculateBMI(weightKg, heightM) {
    // BMI = weight in kg / (height in meters)²
    const bmi = weightKg / (heightM * heightM);
    return bmi.toFixed(1); // Round to 1 decimal place
}

// BAD: Unclear code
function calc(w, h) {
    return w/(h*h);
}
```

---

#### 4. **Python Script Information** 🐍

This tells Claude about the special Python powers available:

**Think of it like:** The chef discovering they have a professional mixer, food processor, and other advanced tools!

```
Regular tools (JavaScript): Good for simple calculators
Power tools (Python): Can do complex math, create multiple files, analyze data
```

    style C fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style D fill:#ab47bc
```

---

### Tool #1: calculator_engine.py — The Calculator Brain 🧠

**What it does:** Performs complex calculations that would be hard to do in a web browser

**Think of it as:** A scientific calculator that can do thousands of calculations per second

#### Capabilities:

**1. Basic Math** ➕➖✖️➗
```python
# Simple example
calc.basic_operation(10, 5, "multiply")
# Result: 50
```

**2. Scientific Functions** 🔬
```python
# Calculate sine, cosine, square root, etc.
calc.scientific_calculation(45, "sin")
# Result: 0.7071 (sine of 45 degrees)
```

**3. Financial Calculations** 💰
```python
# Calculate loan payments
calc.loan_payment(
    principal=200000,    # $200,000 loan
    annual_rate=4.5,     # 4.5% interest
    years=30             # 30 year loan
)
# Result: Monthly payment = $1,013.37
```

**4. Statistical Analysis** 📊
```python
# Analyze a dataset
data = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 45]
calc.statistics(data)
# Result: Mean=53.9, Median=50.5, Std Dev=26.8
```

#### How Claude Uses It:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Claude
    participant Engine as calculator_engine.py

    User->>Claude: "What's the monthly payment<br/>on a $200k loan at 4.5%<br/>for 30 years?"
    
    Note over Claude: This needs complex math!<br/>I'll use Python
    
    Claude->>Engine: loan_payment(200000, 4.5, 30)
    
    Note over Engine: Calculating using formula:<br/>M = P[r(1+r)^n]/[(1+r)^n-1]
    
    Engine-->>Claude: {<br/>  monthly_payment: 1013.37<br/>  total_paid: 364,813.42<br/>  total_interest: 164,813.42<br/>}
    
    Claude-->>User: Your monthly payment<br/>would be $1,013.37<br/><br/>Over 30 years you'll pay<br/>$164,813.42 in interest!
```

#### Real Code Example:

```python
def loan_payment(self, principal: float, annual_rate: float, 
                years: int) -> CalculationResult:
    """
    Calculate monthly loan payment
    """
    # Convert to monthly values
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 100 / 12
    num_payments = years * 12
    
    # Calculate payment using the formula
    payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments) / \
             ((1 + monthly_rate)**num_payments - 1)
    
    total_paid = payment * num_payments
    total_interest = total_paid - principal
    
    return {
        "monthly_payment": round(payment, 2),
        "total_paid": round(total_paid, 2),
        "total_interest": round(total_interest, 2)
    }
```

**Why this is amazing:** Claude can do in 1 second what would take minutes with a regular calculator!

    B --> B3[Any combination]
    
    C --> C1[Financial: Loan, Investment, Savings, Tip]
    C --> C2[Health: BMI, BMR, Body Fat, Water]
    C --> C3[Converter: Length, Weight, Temp, Volume]
    C --> C4[Percentage: All types]
    
    style A fill:#ffb74d,color:#000000
    style B fill:#64b5f6,color:#000000
    style C fill:#ab47bc
```

#### Example: Building a Custom Calculator

**You tell Claude:** "Create a blue calculator that can add, multiply, and calculate powers"

**What happens behind the scenes:**

```python
# Claude calls the generator
generator = CalculatorGenerator()

html = generator.generate_basic_calculator(
    title="My Custom Calculator",
    operations=["add", "multiply", "power"],
    color_scheme="blue"
)

# Save the file
generator.save_calculator(html, "my_calculator.html")
```

**Result:** A complete, working HTML file is created in seconds!

#### The Magic Inside:

The generator has **templates built into the code** that it fills in with your specifications:

```python
def generate_basic_calculator(self, title, operations, color_scheme):
    # Starts with base HTML template
    html = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>{TITLE_GOES_HERE}</title>
        <style>{COLORS_GO_HERE}</style>
    </head>
    <body>
        {CALCULATOR_GOES_HERE}
        {BUTTONS_GO_HERE}
    </body>
    </html>
    """
    
    # Fills in the blanks with your specifications
    # Returns complete, working HTML
    return html
```

### How Claude Uses Examples:

**When you ask:** "Create a tip calculator with bill splitting"

**Claude thinks:**
1. "Let me check the tip calculator example..."
2. "Oh! I can see how they handled tip percentages"
3. "And I can add bill splitting using the same pattern"
4. "Let me create something similar but customized for your needs"

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude
    participant Examples as examples/<br/>tip-calculator.html

    You->>Claude: "Make a tip calculator with<br/>bill splitting for 4 people"
    
    Claude->>Examples: Open tip calculator example
    Examples-->>Claude: Here's how to:<br/>- Calculate tips<br/>- Display results<br/>- Style the interface
    
    Note over Claude: I'll use this as inspiration<br/>and add bill splitting!
    
    Claude-->>You: ✅ Here's your custom<br/>tip calculator with<br/>4-way bill splitting!
```

### What Makes Examples Special:

Examples include **extensive educational comments**:

```javascript
// TIP CALCULATOR - Complete Example
// This demonstrates best practices for calculator creation

function calculateTip() {
    // STEP 1: Get the input values
    // We use parseFloat to convert text to numbers
    const billAmount = parseFloat(document.getElementById('bill').value);
    const tipPercent = parseFloat(document.getElementById('tip').value);
    
    // STEP 2: Validate inputs
    // Always check if the user entered valid numbers!
    if (isNaN(billAmount) || isNaN(tipPercent)) {
        alert('Please enter valid numbers');
        return;  // Stop the function if inputs are invalid
    }
    
    // STEP 3: Calculate the tip
    // Tip amount = bill × (percentage ÷ 100)
    const tipAmount = billAmount * (tipPercent / 100);
    
    // STEP 4: Calculate total
    const totalAmount = billAmount + tipAmount;
    
    // STEP 5: Display results
    // Use toFixed(2) to show exactly 2 decimal places (dollars and cents)
    document.getElementById('tipAmount').textContent = tipAmount.toFixed(2);
    document.getElementById('total').textContent = totalAmount.toFixed(2);
}
```

**Every line is explained!** It's like having a teacher sitting next to you.

## The Cookbook (references/ folder) {#references-folder}

### What is references/?

**The references folder contains reference materials** — formulas, calculations, and explanations that Claude can look up.

**Think of it as:** A cookbook with all the recipes, or a dictionary you look up words in.

### What's Inside: formulas.md

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[📖 formulas.md<br/>The Formula Cookbook] --> B[Basic Arithmetic<br/>➕➖✖️➗]
    A --> C[Percentages<br/>📊]
    A --> D[Financial<br/>💰]
    A --> E[Unit Conversions<br/>📏]
    A --> F[Health<br/>🏃]
    A --> G[Geometry<br/>📐]
    A --> H[Statistics<br/>📈]
    
    style A fill:#ffb74d
```

### Example: The BMI Formula

**From formulas.md:**

```markdown
### BMI (Body Mass Index)

**Metric Formula:**
BMI = weight_kg / (height_m × height_m)

**Imperial Formula:**
BMI = (weight_lbs / (height_inches × height_inches)) × 703

**Categories:**
- Underweight: < 18.5
- Normal: 18.5 - 24.9
- Overweight: 25 - 29.9
- Obese: ≥ 30

**Example:**
Person: 70 kg, 1.75 meters tall
BMI = 70 / (1.75 × 1.75) = 70 / 3.0625 = 22.9
Category: Normal weight
```

### How Claude Uses the Reference:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude
    participant Ref as references/<br/>formulas.md

    You->>Claude: "Create a BMI calculator"
    
    Note over Claude: I need the BMI formula...
    
    Claude->>Ref: Look up BMI formula
    Ref-->>Claude: BMI = weight / (height²)<br/>Metric & Imperial versions<br/>Categories included
    
    Note over Claude: Perfect! Now I have:<br/>✓ Correct formula<br/>✓ Both unit systems<br/>✓ Category ranges
    
    Claude-->>You: Here's your BMI calculator!<br/><br/>[Shows calculator with<br/>both metric and imperial,<br/>plus category indicator]
```

### Why References Are Important:

**1. Accuracy** ✅
```
Claude doesn't have to remember formulas
Looks them up to ensure correctness
No mistakes in calculations
```

**2. Consistency** 🎯
```
Same formula every time
Same categories and ranges
Professional quality
```

**3. Completeness** 📚
```
Includes edge cases
Has examples
Shows best practices
```
