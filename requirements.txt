# Project dependencies (non-standard-library)
# Required for visualization features in `scripts/calculator_engine.py`
matplotlib>=3.4
numpy>=1.21

# Notes:
# - The project uses only Python standard library for core functionality
#   (json, sys, math, typing, dataclasses, enum, datetime, os, collections).
# - matplotlib and numpy are optional; if not installed, visualization
#   features will be disabled (the code falls back gracefully).
# - Pin versions as appropriate for your environment.
